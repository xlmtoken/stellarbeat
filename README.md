Use of the Stellar Network

Some of the Services may help you access the Stellar Network, a distributed ledger network powered by the Stellar open-source protocol, such as through a lightweight client. By accessing the Stellar Network, you may choose to send and receive lumens (also sometimes referred to as “XLM”) and other Stellar assets, build transactions, issue and trade tokens, build smart contracts, and otherwise transact through the Stellar Network. Please note that We do not control the Stellar Network and cannot control activity and data on the network, nor can we control the activities of you or third parties who may develop on the network, validate transactions on the network, or use the network. All activity and data on the Stellar Network is permanent and public.
